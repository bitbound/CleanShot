# CleanShot

A portable Windows app for taking screenshots, creating memes, and recording GIFs.

> Some day, when I have spare time, I'll refactor all this to use proper MVVM architecture.  Maybe even throw in some unit tests.  But until then, I know it's bad.  I was but a wee little programmer back when I created this.

Captures are saved in PNG or GIF format.  Uploads for sharing are sent to a web service at my site (https://jaredg.dev), and they are automatically deleted after 2 weeks.
